# üìù Gender Stereotype Detection in Text  

A deep learning project focused on identifying **gender stereotypes in textual data** using a combination of **classical ML models, transformers, and fine-tuned LLMs**.  

---

## üìå Project Overview  

Gender stereotypes are often embedded in text and can reinforce societal biases. This project explores multiple **machine learning** and **deep learning** approaches to detect such stereotypes in text data, with a focus on **generalization, interpretability, and high accuracy**.  

---

## üöÄ Features  
- Curated and synthesized a dataset of **8,000 IMDb reviews** + targeted stereotype samples.  
- Applied **Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM** as baseline classifiers.  
- Integrated **FLAN-T5 and LLAMA** for advanced NLP classification.  
- Performed **zero-shot and 2-shot prompting** to analyze results.  
- Fine-tuned **LLAMA model with QLoRA adapters**.  
- Achieved **91% accuracy** with **5-fold cross-validation**.
